# Patience-Solitaire
This is the main project submitted for my first year Java assessment. It's a Solitaire game with some limited graphics display from the Javafx library.
It was made in Java 17 and JavaFX libraries on Intellij IDE. It might not run without some finnicky VM options from command line.
